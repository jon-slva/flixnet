# **Flixnet** _(Web)_

**Flixnet** is a simple movie picker application developed by myself and a few friends.

Have you ever felt fatigue with the overwhelming volume of choices in your Netflix queue? **Flixnet** can help you with that!

Just tell **Flixnet** whetyher you want a **_family friendly_** feature, **_how much time you have_** and **_what kind of mood you're in_** and **Flixnet** will give you a list of potential movies for you to pick from!

*This repo is for the **Web** build of **Flixnet**
